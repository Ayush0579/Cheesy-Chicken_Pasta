The ingredients required to make this dish are:

1: Olive oil – A little oil to fry the chicken before cooking it with the sauce.

2: Chicken – Chicken thighs cut into small, bite-sized cubes.

3: Garlic – Fresh is best but if jarred is all you have on hand keep in mind that 1 1/2 teaspoons equals 1 fresh clove.

4: Pasta – Preferrably penne shaped pasta.

5: Broth – Chicken broth.

6: Milk – Use thick fat to make a more viscous sauce.

7: Veggies – My veggies of choice today are some Corn and Capsicum.

8: Cheese – Cream cheese, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese.

9: Seasoning – Salt and pepper, with some Oregano(Optional).
